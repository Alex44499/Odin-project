          My children and husband go nuts over these deviled eggs with sour
          cream. I made them for a potluck at work and have been asked for them
          ever since. (If you can keep people away from them, you're doing
          better than I ever could.) The time I spend prepping this depends on
          how fast you shell your eggs. I have two girls, so we knock this out
          in about 30 minutes (minus cooking time).

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <div class="steps">
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Step</strong>
          <p>
            Place eggs into a large pot and cover with lightly salted water.
            Bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium; boil eggs for 10 to 12
            minutes.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Step</strong>
          <p>
            Drain boiling water and fill the pot with cold water. Let eggs sit
            in cold water for 2 minutes, then pour off water and replace with
            more cold water. Repeat until eggs are thoroughly chilled, 10 to 15
            minutes. Peel eggs; set aside.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Step</strong>
          <p>
            Heat vegetable oil in a small skillet over medium heat; cook and
            stir onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and
            let cool.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Step</strong>
          <p>
            Slice eggs in half lengthwise and scoop yolks into a bowl; transfer
            egg white halves to a plate.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Step</strong>
          <p>
            Mash egg yolks with a fork; stir in sour cream, mayonnaise, ranch
            dressing, Dijon mustard, garlic powder, onion powder, and lemon
            pepper seasoning until yolk mixture is smooth. Stir in sautéed
            onions, bacon bits, and Cheddar cheese.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Step</strong>
          <p>
            Generously fill egg halves with filling and sprinkle each deviled
            egg with paprika. Refrigerate until chilled before serving.
